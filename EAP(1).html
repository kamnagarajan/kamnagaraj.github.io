<p> Hello, Detective. I have assigned you to a death case.
Edgar Allan Poe has died on October 7, 1849. That was two 
weeks ago. But to understand this story, you are going to 
have to go three weeks and five days into the past. On 
September 27, 1849, Edgar Allan Poe left Richmond, 
Virginia, on his way home to New York City. He then dropped 
off the grid until October 3rd, when he was found in Baltimore, 
MD in front of a tavern, delirious and barely alive.  Joseph W. 
Walker, the man who found him and out the main eyewitness, 
found him and wrote this note to Joseph E. Snodgrass (a man 
that Poe had given the name of, he is not 100% credible),</p>

<p id="letterlong">
Baltimore City, Oct. 3, 1849<br>
Dear Sir,<br>
There is a gentleman, rather the worse for wear,
at Ryan's 4th ward polls, who goes under the 
cognomen of Edgar A. Poe, and who appears in 
great distress, & he says he is acquainted with 
you, he is in need of immediate assistance.<br>

Yours, in haste,<br>
JOS. W. WALKER <br>
To Dr. J.E. Snodgrass.<br></p>

<p> Whose evidence do you want to see </p>
