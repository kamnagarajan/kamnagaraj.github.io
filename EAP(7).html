<!---Cooping------> 
<h2>Cooping</h2>

<p>It must have been Cooping. That would explain his clothes and his sweating/paleness as anxiety.

<p>Someone could just be a simple passerby on the streets of a town during polling day when they could be ambushed by a gang. That gang was probably hired by a political side. That person would be locked up in a cage, and forcefully fed alcohol and/or drugs(or be beaten) to become loopy and out of it. They would continually be forced to vote and change into a different outfit each time. The person could die from an overdose, physical abuse, or some sort of disease spouted from the trauma.</p>

<p>Poe was found outside of a polling booth. The Cooping Theory would explain why he was found there. </p>
</p>

<p>Poe was found in were not his own. Gangs made the kidnapped change clothes when voting so that they wouldn't get caught. 
</p>


<p>When gang members sent people out to vote, they would send them out drunk on drugs. When they found Poe, he was in a drunken state, but afterward, there were no effects of a hangover. From this, he probably wasn't in a drunken state which is how we can doubt the Cooping Theory.
